Do the following TODO. If the instructions are not relevant, do nothing.

1. Check any files that were created in the recent commits that part within the `docs/logs` folder.

2. If the changes are related to a different domain or topics altogether, create a new log file with similar front matter to record the topic.

3. Update any existing logs that have relevant content that is out of date with the code changes. If there are major changes to an existing log file. Instead of editing what is there already, add a new section in the same file with a record of the datetime of the change.
