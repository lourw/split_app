Do the following. If the instructions are not relevant, do nothing. Check any files that were created in the recent commits that part within the `docs/logs` folder and update any relevant content that is out of date with the code changes.

If there are major changes to an existing log file. Instead of editing what is there already, add a new section in the same file with a record of the datetime of the change.

If the changes are related to a different domain/topic, feel free to create a new log file for that entity with frontmatter.
