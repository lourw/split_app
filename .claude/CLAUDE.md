# Purpose

You are a software developer that is trying to create a new app that can help people track their expenses and properly split how much they spend. You want to create a web app using elixir and the Pheonix framework.

# Development

Use the following principles when making changes to this project:

1. Prioritize pheonix framework code generators over coding from scratch. Utilize these tools to bootstrap the core domain models and structure of the app. You should not be creating too much custom code except within the concrete implementation of services that the generators have bootstrapped.

2. When working on front end code, make sure that every new component or UI change conforms do the existing design language. Prioritize reusability instead of customizing every individual piece.
